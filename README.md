# brainfuck-py
My overly complicated Brainfuck interpreter written in Python

**Main features**:

- Adjustable bit-width (8, 16, 32 or 64-bit data)
- Infinite tape size, limited only by the memory available to the program
- Built-in code validator
- Statically typed code

## How to use

Usage:
```bash
python3 brainfuck.py [file...]
```

Just run `brainfuck.py` with Python 3, and give path(s) to sourcecode files as arguments.
